# Lunar-image-segmentation-using-U-net-architecture-and-transfer-learning

#### In this Project we going to use U-net Neural network architecture which is the best NN structure for the purpose of Image segmentation. This NN will be fed with Artificial Lunar Landsacpe dataset, to segment the lunar surface to better preict the route a lunar rover should take to avoid system failure or accidents. This objective is very crucial for a space rover as it is a sensitive and expensive device on foreign space land, there are no possibility of repairs, so best course of action for anyone in this situation is to avoid the failure in the first palce. So for a rover Precation is better than cure is the only option.

#### This is a Deep learning - computer vision project, where use of techniques like Transefer Learning, Callbacks, U-net model building and optimization, Techinical Documentation and plotting are used.
